# In-class Lab 6: Readability and Typography
Chadia Bedetse

## Typography
I picked these typefaces, josephin sans and snigglet, because they pair well (accoding to Google Fonts) and convey happiness and playfulness which goes well with the webpage's mood.

## Readability
I decreased max-width of the entire webpage and changed the fonts to make the paragraph easier to read

## CRAP Principles

-I arranged the paragraphs into columns for contrast
-I added color to the headings corresponding to the mood of the webpage and the topic.
