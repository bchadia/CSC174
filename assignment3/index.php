       <h2 class="intro">Intro</h2>
       <p>Skittles candy products, produced by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, come in a wide variety. Most of the varieties are available only in particular regions of the world. The oldest Skittles product is Original Fruit Skittles, which was originally released in Europe in 1974, and was launched in the United States in 1979.[1] The most recent flavor, Sweet Heat, was released in 2018. Earlier Skittles products tended to focus on fruit flavors, more recent products have branched out to include flavors such as chocolate, bubble gum, popcorn, mint, and sours. Skittles products also come in a wide variety of colors, although different Skittles products often use the same colors for sweets with different flavors. For example, the color yellow is associated with lemon flavor in Original Fruit Skittles and as banana berry in Tropical Skittles.</p>

      <h2 class="strawberry">Garden Strawberry</h2>
       <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria Ã— ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries. It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry"> Learn more about Garden Strawberry Skittles</a></p>


      <h2 class="lemon">Lemon</h2>
       <p>The lemon, Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck, is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to South Asia, primarily North eastern India. The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses.[2] The pulp and rind (zest) are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon">Learn more about Lemon Skittles</a></p>

       

       <h2 class="apple">Green Apple</h2>
       <p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple"> Learn more about Green Apple Skittles</a> </p>
