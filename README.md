# In-class Lab 6: Readability and Typography
Chadia Bedetse

## Typography
I picked these typefaces, monsarrat, roboto and open condensed, because they pair well (accoding to Google Fonts) and convey happiness and playfulness.

## Readability
I decreased max-width of the entire webpage and changed the fonts to make the paragraph easier to read

## CRAP Principles

I arranged the paragraphs into columns for contrast
